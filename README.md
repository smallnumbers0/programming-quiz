## Quiz Question Format

Each JSON file in the `src/data/` directory represents a different programming language. Questions follow this schema:

```json
{
  "question": "Question text here?",
  "a": "Option A",
  "b": "Option B", 
  "c": "Option C",
  "d": "Option D",
  "answer": "b"
}
```

## Adding New Programming Languages

1. Create a new JSON file in `src/data/` (e.g., `javascript-class.json`)
2. Add programming questions following the schema above
3. Update the `availableClasses` array in `src/components/ClassSelector.astro`
